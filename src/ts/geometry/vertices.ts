 *
 * When a curve, or a surface is approximated, e.g. by line segments or
 * triangles, vertices are calculated for the approximation (e.g., end points
 * of the line segments, or vertices of the triangles).  This interface
 * decouples the vertex calculator from the storage of calculated vertices.
 *
 * E.g., if we approximate a curve for an WebGL canvas, we may want to store
 * vertices in an array for transfer to a graphics card.  If we approximate
 * a curve for storing in a file format, we may want the vertices as an array
 * of vector objects that we can pass to a file format writer.
